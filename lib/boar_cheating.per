;You can change the usage of boar-resource-cheating by doing the following:
;below you see that the "defrule" only gets executed when the "#load-if"-things are full-filled, so the
;first "defrule" gets executed when the AI plays on easy-difficulty or easiest. The second, some lines below the first, gets executed when the AI
;plays on moderate-, hard-, or hardest - diffficulty. By changing the "NO" into a "YES" or the other way round you can tell the AI when it should cheat the boar resources related
;to the different difficulty-settings.
;Make sure you use capital letters for the "NO" or the "YES".
