# The Duke AI

This is the repo revival of my Age of Empires 2 AI computer player.

* It can play any game mode, civilization, map, difficulty and team setup.
* It only cheats on the "Hardest" difficulty to provide some additional difficulty for expert players.
* It features several strategies, from Feudal age rushes, Knight rushes in early castle age, Eagle man rush, economic booming, etc. It chooses strategies randomly, but has preferences of course depending on the map and team setup.

Feedback is welcome!
