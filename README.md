# The Duke AI

This is the repo revival of my Age of Empires 2 AI computer player.

* It can play any game mode, civilization, map, difficulty and team setup.
* It only cheats on the "Hardest" difficulty to provide some additional difficulty for expert players.
* It features several strategies, from Feudal age rushes, Knight rushes in early castle age, Eagle man rush, economic booming, etc. It chooses strategies randomly, but has preferences of course depending on the map and team setup.

Feedback is welcome!

## Installation

Please put all files with a *.per or an *.ai extension in your AI folder, but please let they stay in there folders.
Move all .mp3 files in the "media" into your "taunt" folder in your Age of Empires 2 installation path.

If you did this you would have to start a new game and you must choose "The Duke-AI" as the player. Then you can play with that AI.

## Taunts

Put all taunts from the "The Duke-AI Media"-folder into your "taunt"-folder in your Age of Empires II folder.

Here is a list of all taunts the Duke-AI can react to. Only allied Duke-AIs can react to taunts. If you send a taunt to a neutral or enemy player he will let you know that you cannot command him.

Press enter and send the number (listed below) to your allies. Make sure you are really chatting with the desired player based on your settings.

For example: Press enter and write 51. This will cause your ally duke to cheat some resources.

## Supported difficulties

Easiest: something like a whole newbie! I think everybody who has never seen a computer yet is able to win!

Easy: a bit better than easiest, but every Age of Empires newbie should be able to win!

Moderate: you play against a well practised player! This should be fun, but on hard or hardest you can enjoy many more tricks, rushes and strategies of The Duke-AI!

Hard, Hardest: these are the most challenging difficulty levels of The Duke-AI (as they should be :)). Here, there are rushes, optimised building strategies.. just most changelling.
The only difference between hard and hardest, is that in hardest goes everything faster and earlier and the rushes are more difficult to defend.
If hardest is too easy for you, then play against 2 or 3 or even more The Duke-AIs, but I think a 2 vs 2 cheating The Dukes on hardest should be hard enough! By the way, on hardest the duke cheats a little bit. On hard the duke does not cheat.

The Duke-AI can take on 3 standard computer opponents which are teamed together (not always, but often) and in one test it could beat phoenixknight and often beats alliance-AI by Dr. Mabuse.

## Todo

* Find out why the duke builds so many mining camps all over the place in late games trying to find the last gold drop-site.
* Build more no-gold units if there is no allied market (or we have no allies) and we do not own a gold drop-site.
